# Minnow :fish:

Minnow (Minimal Window) is a minimalist user interface kit for rapid prototyping, sandboxing, and for small web apps. At it's core is a flexbox grid, a simple set of interface components, component modifiers, and style helpers. Minnow is tiny and adaptableâ€”it's base and component styles are easily modifiable or overwritten.
